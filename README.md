Baruch University STA9760 Fall 2020 semester

This repo contains template definitions and other metadata leveraged from my [airgo](https://github.com/mottaquikarim/airgo) library. The `./static` folder contains build html / css artifacts.

This is essentially an airtable based CMS written with Golang running on Github actions.
